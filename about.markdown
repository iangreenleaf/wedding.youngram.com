# About Us

## Spring 2006

If asked whether they met playing ultimate frisbee in college, both Katherine and Ian tend to shrug and say "Kind of?" It was a small school and their friend groups naturally overlapped (only some of which was due to frisbee).

## Fall 2006

It was an honest coincidence that Katherine and Ian were both set to study abroad in Australia a few months later. Honestly!

## Spring 2010

At the end of Katherine's first year in grad school Ian moved out to California to join her. The next few years involved a lot of exploring in the desert.

Sometimes the desert was mountainous.

Occasionally there was less desert, but still mountains.

## 2016â€¦
